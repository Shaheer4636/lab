# Shibboleth SP Logging and Log Rotation Configuration

## 1. Logging Level Validation

The Shibboleth SP uses `log4shib` for logging configuration, located in:

```
/etc/shibboleth/shibd.logger
```

### Current Configuration:

```
log4j.rootCategory=INFO, shibd_log
```

This confirms logging is set to `INFO` â€” a suitable level for production environments.

## 2. Log Rotation Policy

Shibboleth SP logs via Apache, and the rotation is handled through logrotate using:

```
/etc/logrotate.d/httpd
```

### Updated Logrotate Configuration:

```
/var/log/httpd/*log {
    weekly
    rotate 1
    missingok
    notifempty
    sharedscripts
    compress
    delaycompress
    postrotate
        /bin/systemctl reload httpd.service > /dev/null 2>/dev/null || true
    endscript
}
```

### Key Details:
- `weekly`: Rotates logs every 7 days.
- `rotate 1`: Keeps only **one** rotated log (1 week retention).
- `compress`: Saves space by compressing old logs.
- `postrotate`: Reloads Apache to ensure it starts logging to a fresh file.

## 3. Verification Steps

### To Manually Trigger Rotation:
```
sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/httpd
```

### To Check Log Files:
```
ls -lh /var/log/httpd/
```
