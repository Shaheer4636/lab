We changed the file extension from `.bat` to `.sh` and replaced Windows-specific commands with Linux equivalents. Path separators were updated from `\` to `/`, and variable syntax changed from `%VAR%` to `$VAR`. We replaced `SET` with `export` for environment variables and converted `IF` statements, loops, and command substitutions to Bash syntax. Additionally, `REM` comments were replaced with `#`, and `SET /P` for user input was changed to `read -p`. Finally, execution permissions were added using `chmod +x`.
