# Personal Lab

This is my personal lab repository, primarily built with **yaml (70%)**, to:

- Keep a backup of my learning  
- Share knowledge and best practices  
- Store **YAML**, **Docker Compose**, and **Kubernetes Manifests** for various applications  
- Explore and configure **Istio** and **Ingress** for networking and traffic management  
- Develop and maintain **AWS Lambda functions** and **Lambda layers** as libraries  
- Work on **Microservices architecture** and deployment strategies
