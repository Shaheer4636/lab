File: .yamllint-config.yml
This is a configuration file for the yamllint tool, used to enforce consistent YAML formatting across the repository. It extends the default rule set and specifies exceptions for specific paths (e.g., kustomization.yaml, Kubernetes CRDs, and docs/). It targets all .yaml, .yml, and .yamllint* files.
