I’ve reviewed the requirements from both teams, and the good news is that we can cover them with AWS services. CloudWatch Logs and Insights will give us log aggregation and filtering, X-Ray with OpenTelemetry will handle tracing and request/response metrics, and Container Insights will cover EKS monitoring. For dashboards, alarms, and anomaly detection, CloudWatch (with optional Grafana where needed) is a solid replacement, and RabbitMQ and database metrics can also be brought under the same setup.

To make the switch smooth, I’m planning a phased rollout: start with a pilot on one cluster to validate logging and tracing, then extend it across services with dashboards and alerts added as we go. This keeps us on track to complete the migration before October 31st, with the last weeks focused on fine-tuning and knowledge transfer. The experience won’t look the same as Datadog, but functionally, we’ll have the same visibility and control at a lower cost.
