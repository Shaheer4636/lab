After reviewing the requirements from both Acuity/Strata and VMS teams, I can confirm that replacing Datadog with AWS-native services is feasible and achievable before the October 31st deadline. CloudWatch Logs and Insights will cover log aggregation and filtering, X-Ray with AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry will provide distributed tracing and APM capabilities, and Container Insights will address EKS monitoring. Error tracking and alerting will be handled through CloudWatch queries, alarms, and anomaly detection, while RabbitMQ, database, and infrastructure metrics can all be surfaced via CloudWatch dashboards and, where needed, Grafana for richer visualization.

To ensure a smooth migration, weâ€™ll follow a phased plan: start with a pilot on one EKS cluster to validate traces, metrics, and logs, then expand to all services, dashboards, and alarms. By mid-September, we will aim to have core dashboards and monitoring in place, with the final weeks focused on tuning, documentation, and knowledge transfer. While the user interface will differ from Datadog, the combination of CloudWatch, X-Ray, and Grafana will provide equivalent visibility and control at lower cost.
